SFrame & Turi Create (Turi Create is free and open source.)
Download and install Turi Create: https://github.com/apple/turicreate#installation. 

Note: If you would rather use other ML tools.. such as scikit-learn.  
Use SFrame which will allow you to scale to much larger datasets than Pandas. 
Use Pandas if your machine has sufficient memory. 
If you are not using SFrame, here is the dataset for this assignment in CSV format, so you can use Pandas or other options out there: amazon_baby.csv.
